<b> Exception </b>
        - An Exception is an unwanted / unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, 
          that disrupts the normal flow pf the program instructions.  

<b> Exception Handling </b>
        - The Exception Handling in java is one of the powerfull mechanism,
          to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.  
    
        - All exception and error types are subclasses of the class Throwable, which is the base class of the hierarchy.

    <b> Checked Exception </b>
                - Checked exceptions are called compile-time exceptions because these exceptions are checked at compile-time by the compiler.
 
    <b> Unchecked Exceptions </b> 
                - The unchecked exceptions are just opposite to the checked exceptions. 
                - The compiler will not check these exceptions at compile time. 
                - In simple words, if a program throws an unchecked exception, and even if we didnâ€™t handle or declare it, 
                  the program would not give a compilation error.

    
<b> Try - Catch Block </b>
        - A try-catch block is a set of keywords that handle exceptions caused by coding or data errors during program execution. 
        - The try block is the block of code where exceptions occur. 
        - The catch block handles and catches exceptions from the try block.
    
<b> Finally Block </b>
        - A finally block is a block of code that executes after a try block and any catch block, but before the method is completed. 
        - The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.
        - The finally block is used to put important codes such as clean up code. 
        - For example, closing the file or closing the connection.

<b> Throw Keyword </b>
        - The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block of code. 
        - It's mainly used to throw custom exceptions.
        - The throw statement is used together with an exception type. 
        - Some exception types available in Java include: 
            ArithmeticException, ClassNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException.
        - The throw keyword can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions.

<b> Throws Keyword </b>
        - In Java, the throws keyword is used to declare the exceptions that may occur during a program's execution. 
        - It informs the programmer that an exception may occur, so they can provide exception handling code to maintain the program's normal flow.
        - The throws keyword is used in a method signature.
